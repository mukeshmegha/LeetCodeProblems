You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item.
1773. Count Items Matching a Rule

You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:
ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
Return the number of items that match the given rule.

Example 1:

Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].



class Solution {
    public int countMatches(List<List<String>> items, String ruleKey, String ruleValue) {
        
        int len = items.size();
        int index, count = 0;
        
        if(ruleKey.equalsIgnoreCase("type"))   index = 0;
        else if(ruleKey.equalsIgnoreCase("color")) index = 1;
        else    index = 2;
        
        System.out.println(index);
        for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
            System.out.println(items.get(i).get(index));
            if(items.get(i).get(index).equalsIgnoreCase(ruleValue))
                count++;
        }
        return(count);
    
        
    }
}
